        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <p>
            All game data is stored locally on your device using Android's secure Room Database framework and SharedPreferences. This data is protected by Android's app sandboxing, which prevents other apps from accessing your Stitch Infinite data.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 No Cloud Backup by Us</h3>
        <p>
            We do not use cloud storage or backup services for your game data. Your data remains exclusively on your device. However, Android's automatic backup feature may back up SharedPreferences to your Google account - this is controlled by your device settings.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Data Deletion</h3>
        <p>
            You have full control over your data:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Uninstall:</strong> Uninstalling the App will permanently delete all locally stored game data</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Data:</strong> To delete data collected by third parties, refer to their privacy policies and opt-out mechanisms</li>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page will be revised</li>
            <li>Significant changes may be communicated through an in-app notification</li>
            <li>Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy</li>

        <h2>13. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
            We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Local data is protected by Android's app sandboxing</li>
            <li>No sensitive personal information is collected or transmitted</li>
            <li>In-app purchases are processed securely through Google Play's encrypted systems</li>
            <li>The app uses HTTPS for all network communications with third-party services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Third-party services have their own security measures as described in their policies.
