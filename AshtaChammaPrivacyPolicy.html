    <h1>Privacy Policy for Ashta Chamma</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 5, 2025</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how HK Groups ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Ashta Chamma mobile application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect and Use</h2>
    <p>
        Our commitment is to your privacy. We have designed the App to function with minimal data collection. The data we handle is strictly for providing and improving the game experience. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, or device ID.
    </p>

    <h3>A. Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
    <p>
        To provide a persistent game experience, the App stores certain data directly on your device. This data is not transmitted to us or any third party and remains under your control. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Statistics:</strong> Information such as the number of games played, wins, and losses for both "Player vs. Robot" and "Player vs. Player" modes.</li>
        <li><strong>Saved Game State:</strong> If you pause a "Player vs. Robot" game, we save the current state (like pawn positions and the current player) so you can resume it later.</li>
        <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Your selected pawn colors, sound settings, and visual theme choices are saved to customize your experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Data Transmitted for Online Gameplay</h3>
    <p>
        When you choose to play online ("Player vs. Player" online mode), we need to transmit essential game data to facilitate the real-time experience between you and your opponent.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> This includes your in-game actions like dice rolls, pawn movements, and the current state of the game board. This data is inherently anonymous and is only used to synchronize the game between players.</li>
        <li><strong>Room ID:</strong> A randomly generated, non-personal Room ID is used to connect with another player for a specific game session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The online multiplayer feature of Ashta Chamma is powered by Ably, a third-party real-time messaging service. When you play online, gameplay data is transmitted through Ably's servers to enable communication between players. We do not share any personal information with Ably.
    </p>
    <p>
        We encourage you to review Ably's privacy policy to understand how they handle data.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://ably.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ably Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The App may request the following permission:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>VIBRATE</code>: We use this permission to provide haptic feedback during gameplay events like dice rolls and pawn captures, enhancing the user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We value your trust in providing us your information. All data stored on your device is managed by the secure, sandboxed storage provided by the Android operating system. For data transmitted during online play, we rely on the security measures implemented by our third-party service provider, Ably.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary action.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
